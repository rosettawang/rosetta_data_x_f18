We introduce list processing procedures at the beginning (the text defers lists to chapter 2) to allow for symbolic examples. \\nIn the second week, we discuss higher-order functions, including the use of functions as parameters,\\nthe definition of functions with LAMBDA, and the use of functions that return functions as values. \\nThe third week moves to recursion and covers the topic of processes and orders of growth, introducing the use of iterative algorithms for efficiency.
